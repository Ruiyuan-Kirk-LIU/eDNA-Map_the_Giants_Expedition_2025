Zooxanthellae diversity via **eDNA** method during **Map the Giants Scientific Expedition 2025**  

**Map the Giants** project by MaRHE Center (https://marhe.unimib.it/), University of Milano Bicocca, is investigating the largest coral colonies in the world. The efforts will contribute to revealing the resilience of giant corals to environmental changes and turn them into **marine monuments**. Giant corals provide essential habitats for diverse marine life. Don't hesitate to click this link (https://www.mapthegiants.com/) if you are also interested in coral conservation. **Join the project to map the oldest and most significant monumental corals in our oceans**.  
  
As a PhD student from the University of Tokyo, I participated in the first scientific expedition in 2025. We travelled to the **Central Atolls, Maldives**, to find and conduct sampling on giant coral colonies. During this 8-day cruise, we sampled eight different giant colonies for **eDNA analysis** to test the diversity of zooxanthellae, the symbiotic algae of corals. This repository contains detailed information on the sampling method, data processing, and results.  
  
This notebook will be reliable for researchers interested in **environment DNA** and **coral symbiotic algae**. We welcome all comments, questions, and suggestions. **It will be great to find like-minded academic partners. Reach me at ruiyuanliu0723@gmail.com**
